## Installation

1. Make sure you have user scripts enabled in your browser:

    * Firefox - install [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

    * Only tested on Chrome & Firefox using Tampermonkey & Greasemonkey, but would likely work with other modern browsers and other userscript engines. No extension-specific features are used.
